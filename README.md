### How do I use it?

The most barebones configuration would be:

```yaml
- uses: arturo-lang/bundler@main
  with: 
    token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    entry: yourscript.art
```

> [!TIP]
> The `entry` field represents your app's "entry point" - that is the initial script. Whether it imports other files/scripts or not doesn't matter, since it will - hopefully - be taken care of automatically. Also, you may choose to set the whole folder (in case it's an Arturo *package*) as the entry point: if it is a package with an `info.art` file that declares an `executable:`, it will work as well! ðŸ˜œ

Based on the runner, the action will compile and setup the appropriate, native binary:

| runner | binary |
|--------|--------|
| ubuntu-latest | amd64 / Linux |
| macos-12 | amd64 / macOS |
| macos-latest | arm64 (M1) / macOS |
| windows-latest | amd64 / Windows |

#### More options

| option | description |
|--------|-------------|
| target | change the name of the final binary (default: `'auto'` = use the same name as the entry script) |
| version | set version number, to be included in the archive names - in the case of releases, this will be extracted automatically from the release tag (default: `''`) |

### How can I release an app?

With Arturo's bundler and the appropriate setup, you can instantly offer binaries for all major OSes, as part of your GitHub repo's workflows.

But, panic not! We've got you covered! ðŸ˜‰

Actually it's very streamlined and easy:

- create a `.github/` folder inside your repo
- create a `workflows/` folder inside the above folder (in case it's not already there, obviously)
- create a new file in `./github/workflows/` (name it `asyouwish.yml`)
- copy the contents of [https://github.com/arturo-lang/bundler/blob/main/.github/workflows/testrelease.yml](https://github.com/arturo-lang/bundler/blob/main/.github/workflows/testrelease.yml)
- change only the relevant part above for your own app

> [!NOTE]
> The configuration you have to complete mainly includes 3 fields:
>  - `app-name:` The name of your binary as it will appear
>  - `app-entry:` The "entry point" of your app (see [above^](#how-do-i-use-it))
>  - `app-notes:` (Optionally) add some description that will appear at the bottom of the release

And done! ðŸ’¥

Next time you push a new `vX.Y.Z` tag, a new release will be automatically created, along with all the binaries of your app for Linux/macOS/Windows (and more coming?).

Sounds amazing? It actually *is*! ðŸš€
